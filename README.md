# Timeshifters Mod

A basic framework for modding the Unity based game Timeshifters. This setup requires manual injection (My reccomended injector is SharpMonoInjector)

## Usage

• Clone the repo
• Add reference to the games Assembly-CSharp.dll
• Add reference to any UnityEngine dlls that you need for your feature
• Write your code (you can add as many components as you need to the Entry.o)
• Build solution.
• Inject your DLL with whatever Mono injector you prefer.
• Enjoy your mods.

## ONLINE
I in no way condone cheating online, this framework was made to add vsync as I was getting screen tearing during my story mode playthrough, this has not been tested online and should absolutely not be used to gain any unfair advantage over other players. Lets all have fun and keep it clean <3 Classyham.
